# Polls Recommendation System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document presents the architecture of a Polls Recommendation System, engineered to deliver both personalized and popular poll recommendations. By integrating real-time data processing with sophisticated machine learning algorithms, the system ensures that recommendations remain both dynamic and pertinent to user interests and behaviors.

## System Architecture

This diagram highlights the recommendation system with a real-time improvement loop, often seen in modern application architectures. Here's the process flow and interactions described:

1. **Client Application Requests**: The sequence starts with the client application sending a request to the FastAPI Gateway to get personalized or popular poll recommendations.

2. **FastAPI Gateway**: The FastAPI Gateway retrieves user features from the Feature Store. These user features are essential for the recommendation system to provide personalized content.

3. **Feature Store to Stream Processing (Flink)**: Stream Processing, using a system like Apache Flink, takes the features and runs real-time processing to generate predictions. This processing likely involves complex event processing and real-time analytics.

4. **Predictions through Kafka**: The predictions are then passed through Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, which likely serves as a message broker between the stream processing and the machine learning model.

5. **Machine Learning Model to Redis Filter**: The Machine Learning Model uses the features to predict polls that the user might be interested in. The Redis Filter is then used to remove any polls the user has already seen, ensuring that only fresh polls are recommended.

6. **Real-time Improvement Loop**: As the user interacts with the recommended polls in the client application, these interactions are sent back to the Stream Processing service as events. This updates the features in the Feature Store and improves the model's accuracy over time, hence the loop back to the Feature Store.

The dotted lines indicate the asynchronous operations, and the solid lines represent the direct flow of operations. The feedback loop at the bottom shows that the system learns from user interactions, allowing for continuous improvement of the recommendation system.

## Detailed Component Descriptions and Justifications

### Kafka (Real-time Event Streams)

- **Purpose**: Captures and queues user interaction events in real-time, forming the backbone of our data ingestion layer.
- **Justification**: Selected for its robustness, scalability, and efficient handling of high-volume event streams, Kafka facilitates seamless integration with both stream processing systems and data storage solutions, ensuring no loss of data during peak loads.

### Flink (Stream Processing Service)

- **Purpose**: Consumes events from Kafka to perform real-time analytics and feature extraction, which are essential for updating the feature store used by our machine learning models.
- **Justification**: Flink's ability to process streaming data with low latency makes it ideal for our use case. Its sophisticated state management and exactly-once semantics ensure accurate feature computation, crucial for maintaining the integrity of real-time recommendations.

### Feast (Feature Store)

- **Purpose**: Acts as a repository for storing and serving features to the machine learning models, ensuring that features used during training are consistent with those used during inference.
- **Justification**: Feast offers an efficient, reliable way to manage feature data, providing low-latency access to pre-computed historical features as well as real-time features computed by Flink, facilitating a more personalized and responsive recommendation system.

### Machine Learning Models (Personalization and Popular Polls)

- **Purpose**: Two distinct models cater to different user segments: a personalization model for existing users and a popular polls model for new users.
- **Justification**: This bifurcation allows us to tailor recommendations more precisely. The personalization model can leverage historical interaction data for nuanced recommendations, while the popular polls model ensures new users receive engaging content from the get-go.

### FastAPI (API Gateway)

- **Purpose**: Serves as the interface between client applications and the backend services, managing incoming requests for poll recommendations and orchestrating the workflow of feature retrieval, prediction, and response delivery.
- **Justification**: Chosen for its impressive performance and asynchronous support, FastAPI enables high concurrency handling, making it well-suited for scenarios demanding rapid responses, such as user-facing recommendation engines.

### Redis (Operational Database)

- **Purpose**: Temporarily stores recent poll interactions to filter out previously seen polls from new recommendations, and caches model predictions to reduce computation on frequent requests.
- **Justification**: With its in-memory capabilities, Redis provides extremely fast read/write operations. This is crucial for our systemâ€™s need to offer real-time, dynamic poll recommendations without noticeable latency to the end user.

## Conclusion

The outlined architecture demonstrates a thoughtful integration of real-time data processing, machine learning, and API management to deliver a scalable and responsive Polls Recommendation System. Emphasizing real-time feature preparation and efficient data serving, the system is designed to adapt to user preferences dynamically, thereby enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
